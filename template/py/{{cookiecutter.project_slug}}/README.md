## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Install required tools:

    We recommend using `pipx` for installing `uv`, `ruff`, and `hatch`. If you don't have `pipx`, install it first:

    ```bash
    # Using pip
    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath

    # On macOS
    brew install pipx
    pipx ensurepath

    # On Windows
    scoop install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```

    Then install the required tools:

    ```bash
    pipx install uv ruff hatch
    ```

    Alternative installation methods:

    - Using `uv` itself:

        For macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        uv tool install ruff
        uv tool install hatch
        ```

        For Windows:
        ```powershell
        powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        uv tool install ruff
        uv tool install hatch
        ```

   > Note: Ensure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
   cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   make init         # Create a virtual environment using uv
   make install-dev  # Install development dependencies
   ```

4. Run tests and build:

   ```bash
   make test         # Run tests
   make build        # Build wheel package
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   make compose-up   # Start a compose service, access at http://localhost:8000
   ```
